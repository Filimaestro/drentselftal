MVP:
 - A tool where people can create their own Best Eleven (football)
 - Visualized like a football pitch with 11 jerseys on it
 - The option to change the formation of the team
 - The option to add a player and add the club they played for
 - The club is linked to a dataset of club jerseys so the jersey changes to the proper colors
 - Club is added through a search field (autocomplete)
 - Player is an open text field (that does suggest players after they've been added before)
 - Has to work embedded inside a native app and embedded on a website <!- IMPORTANT >
 - Must allow people to share to Facebook / X / WhatsApp / LinkedIn / Instagram
 - When someone sends in their Best Eleven they have to fill out an e-mailaddress to make sure voting is fair
 - They can also check a checkbox allowing us to send them e-mails

 Extra features:

 - Create a database entry for every unique player added and link them to the club to allow adding players quicker (through autocomplete)
